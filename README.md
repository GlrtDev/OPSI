# OPSI
Project showing how denoising EMG signal with different algorithms works

What's done:
- GUI
- Denoising with Direct Wavelet Transform
- Denoising with EMD (Empirical Mode Decomposition)
- Loading .TXT samples data
- Adding noise to samples (PLI, white noise, baseline wandering)
- Automation of testing algorithms with parameters
